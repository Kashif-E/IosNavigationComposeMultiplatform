# Compose Multiplatform Application with IOS native Navigation for IOS App in common code and Voyager for other platforms

## Experiment: iOS Navigation with Compose Multiplatform ðŸ”´ðŸš§âŒ›ðŸ”„ðŸŸ¢

This project is an experiment to explore how iOS navigation can be implemented using Compose Multiplatform. The goal is to leverage Kotlin Multiplatform capabilities to create a seamless navigation experience on both Android and iOS platforms.

### How It Works

1. **Navigation Setup**: 
   - The `Navigator` class is used to manage navigation between different screens.
   - The `BottomSheetNavigator` is used to handle bottom sheet navigation.

2. **View Controller Wrapping**:
   - The `extendedComposeViewController` function creates a `UIViewController` that hosts a Compose UI.
   - The `UIViewControllerWrapper` class wraps another `UIViewController` and adds gesture recognizer functionality to handle swipe gestures.

3. **Gesture Handling**:
   - The `UIViewControllerWrapper` implements the `UIGestureRecognizerDelegateProtocol` to handle swipe gestures.
   - Swipe gestures are added to the view controller to enable navigation through swiping.

4. **Interactive Pop Gesture**:
   - The `interactivePopGestureRecognizer` is enabled for the entire screen to allow swipe-back navigation.
   - The delegate for the `interactivePopGestureRecognizer` is set to the `UIViewControllerWrapper` to manage the gesture.
